Immune Boost Patches are designed to support your innate immune system and increase the body’s natural defenses. These patches have the ability to help your body build a defense against viruses, bacteria, and parasites while also limiting their ability to spread and move throughout the body. How do Power Sleep patches work? Power Sleep Electroceutical Patches are designed to enhance your sleep. They support your body by helping you obtain deeper, more restorative sleep whether it is a 20-minute nap or a full night’s rest. Unlike other sleep aids, Power Sleep Patches are non-habit forming and do not cause brain fog or grogginess upon waking. What is in the patch? Each patch is charged with the electron signatures of ingredients known to reduce pain and inflammation in the body. Our patches have a thin layer of Mylar, which is a capacitive material that’s able to hold the energetic charge of these ingredients. Once the patch is placed onto the skin, the body’s energetic field (known as the Galvanic Skin Response) induces the flow of electrons from the patch into the body. Our patches use 100% natural ingredients and are free of drugs and chemicals. Our patches contain NO active ingredients, only the electron signatures of each. Is the use of LUMINAS Relief patches considered safe during pregnancy and for children? Our electroceutical patches are safe for people of all ages and may be worn during and after pregnancy. Our patches have no active ingredients, only electrons from natural ingredients. How do I return an item for a refund or exchange? Absolutely. We want you to be thrilled with your purchase.
