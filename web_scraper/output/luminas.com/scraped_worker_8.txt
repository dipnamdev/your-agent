LUMINAS Write Review Sort Clear Filters Order By Newest First Oldest First Most Popular Highest Rating Breakdown 0 0 0 0 0 Search: Product Reviews FAQs What is in the patch? Each patch is charged with the electron signatures of ingredients known to reduce pain and inflammation in the body. Our patches have a thin layer of Mylar, which is a capacitive material that’s able to hold the energetic charge of these ingredients. Once the patch is placed onto the skin, the body’s energetic field (known as the Galvanic Skin Response) induces the flow of electrons from the patch into the body. Our patches use 100% natural ingredients and are free of drugs and chemicals. Our patches contain NO active ingredients, only the electron signatures of each. Is the use of LUMINAS Relief patches considered safe during pregnancy and for children? Our electroceutical patches are safe for people of all ages and may be worn during and after pregnancy. Our patches have no active ingredients, only electrons from natural ingredients. How do I return an item for a refund or exchange? Absolutely. We want you to be thrilled with your purchase.

Each STAMINAPRO patch is charged with the electron signatures of ingredients known to reduce pain and inflammation in the body. Our patches have a thin layer of Mylar, which is a capacitive material that’s able to hold the energetic charge of these ingredients. Once the patch is placed onto the skin, the body’s energetic field (known as the Galvanic Skin Response) induces the flow of electrons from the patch into the body. Our patches use 100% natural ingredients and are drug and chemical-free. Our patches contain NO active ingredients, only the electron signatures of each. How does it work? Electrons are imprinted into the patch and work naturally with your body’s own electric field to activate the innate natural healing responses that relieve pain and restore balance. For the geeks and scientists among us: Each patch contains 5.2 x 10^19 molecular structures per square inch, each with 2 oxygen polar bonding areas capable of holding a targeted, host electron, creating a total possible charging capacity equal to 10.4 x 10^19 host electrons per square inch. After considering the average transmission field voltage of humans (200 micro volts) we can calculate the relative capacity, per square inch of patch, at 333 Pico Farads. How long do the patches last? Once applied to the skin, the patches are effective for up to 24 hours. They’re water-resistant so you can wear the patches while bathing, showering, swimming, and exercising. How long does it take to feel relief? Patches begin working immediately but each person feels the effects at different points in time. Once applied to the skin, patches are effective for up to 24 hours. You can wear them while bathing, showering, swimming, and exercising. Can I cut the patches? Do NOT cut the patches. If you cut the patches, the charge will be lost, and the patches will no longer be effective. Can I wear more than one patch at a time? Absolutely! There is no harm in wearing multiple patches. We recommend starting with 2+ patches on or adjacent to the area of pain or discomfort. Then, you can add or remove patches as you feel needed. Do you have product certification from NSF or other testing groups? STAMINAPRO patches contain no active ingredients, no drugs, no chemicals, no supplements. Our products are FDA listed and we are classified as a 510K Exempt Medical Device (equal to any other athletic tape product from a safety perspective). STAMINAPRO Patches are devices listed with the FDA and manufactured in California in an establishment registered with the FDA. The patches are categorized as a Class I Medical Device and FDA regulated under §890.5710. Representations regarding the efficacy and safety of Luminas have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. These products are not intended to diagnose, prevent, treat, or cure any disease. When can I expect my order to arrive? STAMINAPRO ships most orders on the same day if placed before 3:00pm PST. We ship via USPS First Class Mail by default, which typically takes 2-5 days domestically, and 3-14 days in most countries outside the US. If you choose the expedited option, we ship via USPS Express Mail, which typically arrives 1-2 days after the order was placed. What is the return policy? STAMINAPRO has a 30-day return policy. More than half of the patches must be unused and returned within 30-days of purchase to qualify for a full refund. Please contact our Customer Experience team for any questions or concerns.
